# Conway's Game of Life - Roc8 - Moonshot

## Overview

This project is a web implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to simulate the game's behavior, allowing users to interact with a grid of cells that evolve based on specific rules. The project is developed as part of the Roc8 Moonshot Assignment.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: A 30x30 grid where each cell can be toggled on or off by clicking on it.
- **Start/Stop Simulation**: Control the simulation with a button to start or stop the evolution of the grid.
- **Randomize Grid**: Generate a random initial state for the grid with a click of a button.
- **Instructions**: Clear instructions to help users start the game.

## How to Use

1. **Initialize the Grid**:

   - The grid is automatically initialized when the page loads.
   - Click on any cell to toggle its state between alive and dead.

2. **Start/Stop the Game**:

   - Click the "Start" button to begin the simulation.
   - Click the same button (now labeled "Stop") to halt the simulation.

3. **Randomize the Grid**:
   - Click the "Randomize" button to fill the grid with a random pattern of alive and dead cells.
